This site is affiliated to ARC Training Centre for Information Resilience. The Centre for Information Resilience (CIRES) is an Australian Research Council (ARC) Industrial Transformation Training Centre funded for 5 years from 2021. Our Centre aims at building workforce capacity in Australian organisations to create, protect and sustain agile data pipelines, capable of detecting and responding to failures and risks across the information value chain in which the data is sourced, shared, transformed, analysed and consumed. Building on strong foundations of responsible data science, we bring together end-users, technology providers, and cutting-edge research, to reduce the socio-technical barriers to data driven transformation. We support the development of resilient data pipelines capable of delivering game-changing productivity that position Australian organisations at the forefront of technology leadership and value creation from data assets. Professor Shazia Sadiq is the CIRES Centre Director.
